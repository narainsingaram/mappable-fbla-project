## 🤔 What is Mappable?
Mappable is a web app that assist in increasing student involvment within school communtiies by tracking participation and attending in events created by teachers and adminstrators in the school. Students and Teachers can receive points and gems for checking into events, and creating the events which allows users to redeem incentivites with the gems currency.  Each quarter, there is a report and leaderboard developed to demonstrate how everyone has performed points and gem wise; these can also award students with rewards. Users can also create Spaces in the web app which basically allow users to collaborate and discuss about the development and scheduling of school-related events. To improve productivity of the users, there is an notification system so users can instantly respond to actions happening within the app without any time to waste.
